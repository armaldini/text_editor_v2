# Text Editor v2

To use this editor you can select words (or phrases) and change the font color, make it bold, underlined or italic, using the controls located in the top bar.

You can also select a word and see a list of synonyms, and even replace the selected word by clicking on one of them.

I learned a lot doing this, and even though it was pretty frustrating at first, I had fun doing it. I wish I had more time or previous experience doing this kind of thing in js. I was totally out of my comfort zone.

It's not perfect or polished, but I think it's good enough to leave it like it is for now.
