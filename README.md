# Text Editor v2

To use this editor you can select words (or phrases) and change the font color, make it bold, underlined or italic, using the controls located in the top bar.

You can also select a word and see a list of synonyms, and even replace the selected word by clicking on one of them.

It's not perfect or polished, but I think it's good enough to leave it like it is for now.
